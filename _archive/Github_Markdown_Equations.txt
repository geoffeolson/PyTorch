Important GitHub Markdown + LaTeX Rules (From Your Fixes)
These are rules we can record in your “GitHub Markdown Equations” document:

Use $...$ for inline math.

Use $$...$$ for display math.

Avoid \mathbf{x}_{ij} — especially multiple subscripts inside bolded variables.

Prefer simple subscripted variables like x_{ij}, z_{ij}, A_{ij}.

Avoid commands not supported by KaTeX, such as \begin{align}, \eqref, \text{}, etc.

Avoid escaped control characters (\b, \t, etc.) inside strings opened in Windows editors like Notepad++ — use editors like Visual Studio Code, or GitHub’s online editor.

Use double backslashes \\ for line breaks inside matrices.

Don’t nest too many environments inside one equation (especially on GitHub).

Test changes incrementally on GitHub to ensure rendering before committing all math-heavy sections.

✅ Confirmed LaTeX Formatting Rules
Use Single Dollar Signs for Inline Math
Inline equations should use $...$.
Example:
$E = mc^2$

Use Double Dollar Signs for Block Math
Block equations should use $$...$$, with no indentation.
Example:

markdown
Copy
Edit
$$
H = J^T \Omega J
$$
Avoid Extra Newlines Inside Math Blocks
Do not insert a blank line before or after $$. This may break rendering.
❌ Incorrect:

markdown
Copy
Edit
$$

x^2 + y^2 = z^2

$$
✅ Correct:

markdown
Copy
Edit
$$
x^2 + y^2 = z^2
$$
No LaTeX Environments (e.g., \begin{bmatrix})
GitHub Markdown does not support LaTeX environments like bmatrix, align, or cases. Use simple inline notation instead.
❌ \begin{bmatrix} ... \end{bmatrix}
✅ Use manual formatting like \left[ \begin{array}{cc} ... \end{array} \right] or break into separate lines with plain formatting.

Avoid Backslashes Before Non-LaTeX Commands
GitHub interprets sequences like \b, \f, \t as escape characters. These should be written carefully or avoided in .md files.
✅ Use raw string literals or code blocks to prevent escaping, or replace \t with \\t in literal strings.

Avoid Using Multiple Subscripts with \mathbf{}
GitHub LaTeX rendering often breaks when using multiple subscripts in bolded symbols.
❌ \mathbf{x}_{ij} (works only once per block, breaks after that)
✅ Prefer x_{ij} or drop bolding unless absolutely needed.

Do Not Mix Bullet Lists and Block Math Without Care
When placing block math inside a list item, ensure it is indented properly and doesn't conflict with the list structure. See proposed rule 10.

Use UTF-8 Compatible Editors
Avoid editors (like Notepad++) that automatically convert backslashes or escape sequences, which may corrupt LaTeX. Use Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or GitHub’s web editor instead.

Test Your Markdown in GitHub Directly
GitHub's LaTeX rendering differs from local editors. Always test .md rendering by previewing on GitHub itself.

🔄 Proposed Rule 10: Equations Inside Bullet Lists
When using LaTeX block equations ($$...$$) inside a bullet list, GitHub will not render them properly unless the math block is treated as part of the list item’s content. Here are a few strategies:

❌ Don't Do This:
markdown
Copy
Edit
- Step 3:
$$
H = J^T \Omega J
$$
GitHub often breaks rendering in this structure.

✅ Recommended:
Step 3: Use the system matrix and right-hand vector:

𝐻
=
𝐽
𝑇
Ω
𝐽
,
𝑏
=
𝐽
𝑇
Ω
𝑒
H=J 
T
 ΩJ,b=J 
T
 Ωe
Keep the math block indented and part of the same list level as the bullet text.

Alternatively, inline short equations using single $ delimiters:

Step 3: Use the formula $H = J^T \Omega J$ to build the system.
