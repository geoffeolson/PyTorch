We are creating a document that describes a validation workflow for reformatting LaTeX embedded in a Markdown document. The objective is to take a document that renders properly in ChatGPT and reformat it so that it renders correctly on GitHub.

Several LaTeX formatting rules have been established to address known rendering issues on GitHub. These rules are documented separately and will be consolidated into a single validation document, `Rules_Combined.md`. The following workflow will be used to incrementally build and test the rules:

### Validation and Testing Workflow

1. **Starting Point**

   * Begin with the baseline document `Rules_Combined.md` which includes the currently implemented rules.

2. **Validation Test**

   * Apply the current set of validation rules from `Rules_Combined.md` to reformat the source document `README_render_in_chatgpt.md`.

3. **Download for Review**

   * Download and deliver the reformatted version of the README to the user for manual inspection.

4. **Feedback Loop**

   * The user provides feedback on formatting issues or unexpected results.
   * All feedback is tested—no change is accepted without validation.

5. **Incremental Rule Integration**

   * Introduce one rule at a time into `Rules_Combined.md`.
   * After each addition, repeat steps 2–4 to verify correctness and ensure the rule behaves as expected in isolation.

This disciplined process ensures each rule is validated from a known and controlled document state, eliminating unintended interactions between rules and improving the reliability of LaTeX rendering in GitHub Markdown.

# LaTeX Validator

This validator ensures that LaTeX equations in a Markdown file used for GitHub will properly rendered.

### Rule 1: Inline LaTeX Delimiters

**Detect Inline LaTeX:**

- Identify LaTeX expressions intended to be inline (on a line with surrounding text).
- If the inline math is not wrapped in **single dollar signs (`$...$`)**, replace the incorrect delimiters (e.g., `\(` and `\)`, or others) with `$`.
- Ensure there are **no spaces inside the delimiters**.
- Ensure there is **at least one space or punctuation mark** separating the math expression from the surrounding text (e.g., `poses $x_i$ and`).

**Example Fix:**

Incorrect: \( x = y \),poses$x=y$and  
Correct: poses $x = y$ and

**Trim Spaces Inside Inline Math Delimiters**

- After converting inline math to use `$...$`, remove **leading and trailing spaces inside** the delimiters.

**Example Fixes:**

Incorrect: $ x + y $  
Correct: $x + y$

**Implementation Note:**  
Before inserting the delimiters, trim whitespace around the expression so that `$ expression $` becomes `$expression$`.

---

### Rule 2: Block LaTeX Delimiters

**Detect Block LaTeX:**

- Identify LaTeX expressions intended as display blocks (on their own lines).
- If the block math is not wrapped in **double dollar signs (`$$...$$`)**, replace the incorrect delimiters (e.g., `\[ ... \]`, or incorrect single `$`) with `$$`.
- Ensure there are **no extra blank lines** within the block.
- Ensure there are **no extra spaces before or after** the `$$` delimiters.

**Example Fix:**

Incorrect:
```
\[
x = y + z
\]
```
Correct:
```
$$
x = y + z
$$
```



**Trim Spaces Inside Block Math Delimiters**

- When wrapping block math expressions with `$$...$$`, ensure there are **no extra spaces or newlines** inside the delimiters.

**Example Fixes:**

Incorrect: $$ x + y $$  
Correct: $$x + y$$

**Implementation Note:**  
Trim both leading/trailing spaces and newlines from the expression before wrapping it in `$$...$$`. This avoids rendering issues in GitHub Markdown.

---

### Rule 7: Avoid Block LaTeX Inside Lists

Block math using `$$...$$` should not be placed directly inside list items (bulleted or numbered), as this breaks rendering in GitHub-flavored Markdown.

**Problem**

GitHub does not reliably render block LaTeX when it appears inside list items like:
```
- This will break:
  $$
  x = y + z
  $$
```

**Approved Workarounds**

1. **Use inline math** if the expression is short:
```
- Update using $x \leftarrow x + \delta$
```
2. **Move the block math outside the list:**
```
- Update the pose estimate.

$$
x \leftarrow x + \delta
$$
```

**Validation Tip**

Check for `$$` blocks that immediately follow list markers like `-`, `*`, or `1.` and ensure they are either converted to inline or moved out of the list structure.

### Rule 3: Avoid `_{ij}` Outside of Command Braces in Repeated Expressions

GitHub Markdown has a rendering bug where repeated LaTeX expressions like:
```
\mathbf{x}_{ij} \quad \mathbf{x}_{ij} \quad \mathbf{x}_{ij}
```
Only the **first** instance renders correctly. The second and third often fail to display the subscript.

**Approved Solution**

Wrap the subscript **inside** the braces of the LaTeX command:
```
\mathbf{x_{ij}} \quad \mathbf{x_{ij}} \quad \mathbf{x_{ij}}
```

This avoids triggering the rendering bug while preserving clarity and LaTeX semantics.

**Do Not Use**
```
\mathbf{x}_{ij} \quad \mathbf{x}_{ij}
```
This format causes GitHub to misrender the second and later occurrences.

**Why This Works**

GitHub parses repeated subscript expressions poorly when the `_` appears outside of the LaTeX command braces. Grouping both the base and subscript as a single argument (e.g. `x_{ij}`) avoids this bug.

**Implementation Guidance**

In validator logic, replace:
```
\command{x}_{ij}
```
With:
```
\command{x_{ij}}
```
This form is safe and requires no additional escaping or spacing fixes.

# Example LaTeX for Testing
The follow text has embedded latex that will not properly render GitHub. This document will be used to test the LaTeX validation rules.  After appling the rules, the LaTeX should render correctly in GitHub.

### Algorithm Summary

1. **Initialization**

   - Initialize all poses (nodes) with estimates.
   - Construct a factor graph where each edge encodes a relative pose constraint between two poses.

2. **Linearization**

   - For each constraint (edge), compute the error between the predicted and observed relative pose.
   - Linearize the error function using Jacobians \( A_{ij} \) and \( B_{ij} \) with respect to the involved poses \( x_i \) and \( x_j \).

3. **Construct System**

   - Use Jacobians to populate the information matrix \( H \) and vector \( b \):

     \[
     H = J^\top \Omega J \qquad b = J^\top \Omega e
     \]

   - \( \Omega \) is the information (inverse covariance) matrix of the measurement.

4. **Solve**

   - Solve the linear system \( H \delta = -b \) using a sparse solver (e.g., Cholesky decomposition).
   - Update the poses: \( x \leftarrow x + \delta \)

5. **Iterate**

   - Repeat linearization and solving until convergence (change in \( \delta \) is small).

### Pose Definitions

\[
x_i = \begin{bmatrix} x_i \\ y_i \\ \theta_i \end{bmatrix}, \quad
x_j = \begin{bmatrix} x_j \\ y_j \\ \theta_j \end{bmatrix}, \quad
\Delta t = \begin{bmatrix} x_j - x_i \\ y_j - y_i \end{bmatrix}
\]

Let the rotation matrix of pose \( x_i \) be:

\[
R_i \in \mathbb{R}^{2 \times 2}
\]

and define the skew-symmetric matrix:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & -1 \\
1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
\]

### Error Function and Observations

Each edge in the graph represents a constraint based on a relative pose observation:

\[
\mathbf{z}_{ij} = 
\begin{bmatrix} 
\Delta\mathbf{x}_{ij} \ \Delta\mathbf{y}_{ij} \\ 
\Delta y_{ij} \ \Delta\theta_{ij} \end{bmatrix}
\]

This observation represents the expected transformation from node \( i \) to node \( j \), measured in the coordinate frame of node \( i \).

The predicted relative pose based on current estimates is:

\[
\hat{z}_{ij} = \begin{bmatrix} 
R_i^\top (t_j - t_i) \\ 
\theta_j - \theta_i \end{bmatrix}
\]

The error function is the difference between the observed and predicted relative pose:

\[
\mathbf{e}_{ij} = \mathbf{z}_{ij} - \hat{z}_{ij}
\]

This error is used in the least-squares cost function that drives the optimization.

### Jacobians

The Jacobians of this function are with respect to the two involved poses \( x_i \) and \( x_j \).

\[
A_{ij} =
\begin{bmatrix}
-R_i^\top & R_i^\top S \Delta t \\
0_{1 \times 2} & -1
\end{bmatrix}
\]

\[
B_{ij} =
\begin{bmatrix}
R_i^\top & 0_{2 \times 1} \\
0_{1 \times 2} & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\]

### Summary

- These Jacobians are used to populate the sparse system matrix \( H \) and vector \( b \) in SLAM optimization.
- The rotation matrix \( R_i^\top \) transforms global coordinates to local frame \( i \).
- The skew-symmetric matrix \( S \) arises from the derivative of a rotation operation.
